Term Project
“Puppy Mill” Web Site
Your mission is to create a fully functional e-commerce social web site application that sells “puppies”.
This site MUST include the following:
1. An API(s) that is used to provide full shopping cart functions
2. An API(s) that provides credit card verification
3. An API that provides blogging ability
4. An API that provides e-mail newsletter sign up
5. API(s) for signing into the site using today’s most common social media sites (such as Google+, Twitter)
6. Youtube API for searching and organizing youtube videos (of your pets)
7. Include access to Google+, Twitter, Youtube, and other social media sites.
8. Include the ability to read and display news (RSS2) items from other related web sites.
9. Additional API’s that make the site a complete professional functioning web site.
There should be a section of the web site that displays information without signing in. There should also be a section of the web site that you MUST sign in (such as purchasing a puppy). Sign in ability should be allowed by creating an id on the site, AND will also be allowed by signing into Google and/or Twitter.
You may use any language(s) or tools that you choose. You MUST have a Web Page Interface. However, you can also have an additional mobile web page access or mobile app.
Make sure that you are using true API(s) and not plug-ins. You can use a CMS system is you choose. However, you must use external API’s, not CMS plug ins.
The “goal” is to use as many existing “free” API’s as needed to reduce actual coding and increase actual reliability of the site.
You must host the web site on a server external from the school. You can host the site anywhere you choose. However, the instructor must be able to access the site externally.
The site must include a page(s) with links to the actual code used in the web site. The code should be placed in text files, so clicking the link will display (or download) the code without the code executing. Only provide the code you created (such as code to access an API) not the actual code for the API(s) themselves.
A writeup of your proposal for this project is due in class on Tuesday (9/24).
